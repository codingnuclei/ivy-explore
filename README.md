# IVY-EXPLORE

This workspace was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.5.

It has projects that explore how we can use IVY to get the most out of Angular.

Many of the projects use private APIs, and as such are subject to breaking changes.  Use in production is at your own risk!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
